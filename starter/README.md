# Rock, Paper, Scissors refactor

You have been given code for a rock/paper/scissors game. Start by running it
in the console by typing `node rps.js` in the console.

In this game, you pick either rock, paper or scissors while your AI opponent
does the same. Then the choices are compared to determine the winner.

* Rock beats scissors, loses to paper and ties with rock.
* Paper beats rock, loses to scissors and ties with paper.
* Scissors beats paper, loses to rock and ties with scissors.

The code works but the author has never heard of the DRY or SRP principles.
Your task is to refactor the code for readability and maintainability using
DRY and SRP principles.
